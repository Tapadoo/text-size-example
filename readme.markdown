# Text Sizing Example App

Quick android app to show off the effects of sizing text at different dp, sp , and px levels. Also some box sizes in dp and px.

Also nice for running size by side on different screen resolutions to get a feel for how similar or different measurements will feel on different size devices.

there are some static and interactive controls to show how the platform does things.
